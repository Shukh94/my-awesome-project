          <h2>Especially Indian Classic Music</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <strong>Indian classical music</strong> is the classical music of
            the Indian< subcontinent. It has two major traditions: the North
            Indian classical music known as <em>Hindustani</em> and the South
            Indian expression known as <em>Carnatic</em>. These traditions were
            not distinct until about the 15th century. During the period of
            Mughal rule of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and
            evolved into distinct forms. Hindustani music emphasizes
            improvisation and exploration of all aspects of a raga, while
            Carnatic performances tend to be short composition-based. However,
            the two systems continue to have more common features than
            differences.

        <h3>Major traditions</h3>
        <p>
          The classical music tradition of the ancient and medieval Indian
          subcontinent (modern Bangladesh, India, Pakistan) were a generally
          integrated system through the 14th century, after which the
          socio-political turmoil of the Delhi Sultanate era isolated the north
          from the south. The music traditions of the North and South India were
          not considered distinct until about the 16th century, but after that
          the traditions acquired distinct forms.[2] North Indian classical
          music is called Hindustani, while the South Indian expression is
          called Carnatic (sometimes spelled as Karnatic). According to Nazir
          Ali Jairazbhoy, the North Indian tradition acquired its modern form
          after the 14th or the 15th century.
